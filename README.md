# patternq5.cpp
This C++ program prints a reverse right-angled triangle pattern using stars (*).  The program begins by taking an integer input n, which represents the maximum number of stars in the first row (actually n+1 stars because the loop condition uses &lt;= n). The main logic of printing the triangle is inside the function print5(int n).
